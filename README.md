Swagger spec for ArcGIS Online's REST API

[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) (now known as: [Open API Initiative](https://openapis.org/)) is a simple yet powerful representation of RESTful APIs. Much like what [WSDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language) documents did to [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) APIs, Swagger does for REST APIs. It allows for documentation, code generation for client and server, and enable better testing and coding tools.  
This library offers the swagger spec for the [ArcGIS Online REST API](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/). It's the base for other libraries that can use this document.  

### Coverage
