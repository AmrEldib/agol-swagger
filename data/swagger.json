Developers using the API must take care to protect the token against malicious use just as they would the original credentials, and they must be prepared to renew the token. Expired tokens will be rejected by the server. From version 2.1, the generateToken operation also supports generation of a server-token in exchange for a portal token. This server-token is required for clients to access resources from a federated server. The parameters token and serverUrl are required to generate a server-token. See the descriptions of these parameters below for additional information. Organizations that choose to implement higher levels of security for their organizations can set the allSSL setting to true for their organization or portal. The effect of setting allSSL to true is that all non-HTTPS requests for resources belonging to the organization will be rejected. Setting allSSL to true guarantees that all transmissions of access tokens as well as data between clients and servers is over a secure encrypted channel and provides protection to tokens and data in transit. When generateToken is called for a user in such an organization, it returns a response property of ssl=true, and the token must always be passed back via HTTPS to the portal.",

If you specify a destinationitemId, the new item is added as the origin item. If you specify both, an error is thrown. The relationship creation is done after the item is created. If the item doesn’t add correctly, no relationship is created. If the item adds correctly, but the relationship fails (that is, bad relationship type, invalid origin or destination item, and so on), the item is deleted.

Developers using the API must take care to protect the token against malicious use just as they would the original credentials, and they must be prepared to renew the token. Expired tokens will be rejected by the server. From version 2.1, the generateToken operation also supports generation of a server-token in exchange for a portal token. This server-token is required for clients to access resources from a federated server. The parameters token and serverUrl are required to generate a server-token. See the descriptions of these parameters below for additional information. Organizations that choose to implement higher levels of security for their organizations can set the allSSL setting to true for their organization or portal. The effect of setting allSSL to true is that all non-HTTPS requests for resources belonging to the organization will be rejected. Setting allSSL to true guarantees that all transmissions of access tokens as well as data between clients and servers is over a secure encrypted channel and provides protection to tokens and data in transit. When generateToken is called for a user in such an organization, it returns a response property of ssl=true, and the token must always be passed back via HTTPS to the portal. http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Generate_Token/02r3000000m5000000/",
